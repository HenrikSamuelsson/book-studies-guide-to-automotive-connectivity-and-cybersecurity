> What is meant by the term _global automotive market_?

Global automotive market describes the total volume of car sales, estimated or actual, for a given year or period, in the entire world.

The number of cars produced each year have grown for many years in a row. Now roughly 100 million cars are produced each year. There are likely more than 1 billion cars in use in the world. Meaning a ratio of about 8 to 1 between humans and cars so we are still far away from every human owning a car of their own.

> What was the worldwide production of cars in 2012?

The worldwide production of cars a given year will vary depending on the statistics source used and it is hard to know what the exact number really is. Anyway, a number that often seems to come up for 2012 is that 63 million cars was produced this year.

Asia dominated the car production in 2012, with China in the lead. followed by Japan. Germany comes in at third place in the world, and was the major player in Europe. South Korea was fourth and USA was fifth. Then followed India, Brazil, Russia, Mexico, and France. Many other countries produce cars besides these top ten.

> What shifts have occurred in the last decade regarding the different markets?

EU, North America and East Asia had about equal share of the car production back in year 2000. But by year 2010 so had to production numbers shifted so that East Asia was clearly in the lead, now producing more cars than EU and North America together. East Asia's dominance have then continued up to present time, i.e. year 2020.

> What is meant by _penetration of cars/the ratio of cars to inhabitants_?

The ratio of cars to inhabitants is the relation between the  number of cars and number of people living in a country or region. Assume that a country have 1000 cars and 4000 people, the rato will then be 1 to 4. The ratio is about 1 to 2 in EU, Japan, and USA. All the people in these regions can easily be fitted in the cars at the same time, since most cars takes more than 2 people. On the other hand so was the ratio in China 1 to 20 in 2016. The number of cars in China is increasing faster than the number of people but it would at this time probably not be possible for all Chinese to take a road trip at the same time.
