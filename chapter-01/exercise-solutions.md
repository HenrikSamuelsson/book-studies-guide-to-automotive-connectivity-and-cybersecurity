Global automotive market describes the total volume of car sales, estimated or actual for a given year or period, in the entire world.

The number of cars produced each year have grown for many years in a row. Now roughly 100 million cars are produced each year. There are likely more than 1 billion cars in use in the world. Meaning a ratio of about 8 to 1 between humans and cars so we are still far away from every human owning a car of their own.

Asia dominated the car production in 2012 with China in the lead followed by Japan. Germany comes in at third place in the world and was the major player in Europe. South Korea was fourth and USA was fifth. Then followed India, Brazil, Russia, Mexico, and France. Many other countries produce cars besides these top ten.
